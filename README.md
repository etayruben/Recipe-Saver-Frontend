# Recipe-Saver Frontend Project

Welcome to the Recipe-Saver frontend project! This readme file will guide you through the necessary steps to set up and start the front-end application for Recipe-Saver.

This project is done for my self-development and my friend's comfort

## Project Overview
Recipe-Saver is a front-end application that displays recipes as cards on a web page. It communicates with the Recipe-Saver backend API to retrieve and delete recipe data. The front-end is built using React with TypeScript and utilizes the Material-UI (MUI) library for UI components.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- Node.js (latest version)
- React (latest version)
- TypeScript (latest version)
- Material-UI (latest version)

1. Clone the repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/recipe-saver-frontend.git`
2. Change to the project directory: `$ cd recipe-saver-frontend`
3. Install dependencies: `$ npm install` or `$ yarn install`

## Configuration
Before running the application, you may need to configure the API endpoint. Follow these steps to set up the necessary configuration:
1. Open the `src/config.ts` file.
2. Update the `API_ENDPOINT` constant to point to the URL where the Recipe-Saver backend API is running.

## Running the Application
To start the frontend application for Recipe-Saver, follow these steps:
1. Run the application: `$ npm start` or `$ yarn start`.
2. The application should start running on the specified port (default is `3000`).
3. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL where the application is running.
4. You should see the recipe cards displayed on the page.

That's it! You should now have the Recipe-Saver frontend project set up and running. If you have any questions or run into any issues, please refer to the project documentation or feel free to reach out to the project maintainers. Enjoy browsing and managing your recipes!
